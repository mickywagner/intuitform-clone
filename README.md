<h3>About This Project</h3>
<p>This project was mainly practice for creating HTML/CSS forms I made for the HTML/CSS course on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project</a>. Though 
the focus was making as close a copy as possible to the real Intuit form, I also did some form validation with the Constraint Validation API.
